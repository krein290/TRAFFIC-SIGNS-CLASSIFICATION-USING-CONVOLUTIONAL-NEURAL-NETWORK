# Traffic-Signs-Classification

Tech Stack - Python(Root language), NLP, Keras, DataCleaning Algo, etc.

- The main objective of our project is to design and
construct a computer based system which can automatically detect the road signs so as to provide assistance to the user or the machine so that they can take appropriate actions. The proposed approach consists of building a model using convolutional neural networks by extracting traffic signs from an image using color information. We have used convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify the traffic signs and we used color based segmentation to extract/crop signs from images.
